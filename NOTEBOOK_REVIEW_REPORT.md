## Issues Found and Fixed

### 🔧 Issue #1: Reverse Cell Order (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Problem:**
- Cells were inserted in reverse order during creation
- Phase 2 cells (32-48 in final) were at positions 48-64
- Phase 3 cells (49-64 in final) were at positions 32-47
- This would cause the notebook to display Phase 3 before Phase 2

**Root Cause:**
- Used `edit_mode=insert` with same `cell_id` reference repeatedly
- Each insert added cells AFTER the reference cell
- This created a stack-like (LIFO) ordering

**Fix Applied:**
- Read notebook and extracted all cells
- Identified Phase 1 (cells 0-31), Phase 2 (reversed), Phase 3 (reversed)
- Reversed both Phase 2 and Phase 3 cell lists
- Reconstructed notebook in correct order: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
- Saved corrected notebook

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Notebook now has correct cell ordering

---

### ⚠️ Issue #2: Variable Dependencies

**Potential Problem:**
Some cells use variables defined in previous cells. If cells are run out of order, this could cause errors:

- Cell 33 (Phase 2 summary) uses `avg_reduction`, `arabic_keywords`, `english_keywords`
- Cell 49 (Phase 3 summary) uses `sentiment_percentages`, `correlation`

**Mitigation:**
- These variables ARE defined in earlier cells within each phase
- As long as phases are run sequentially, no issues
- Notebook structure enforces linear execution

**Status:** ⚠️ NOTED - No fix needed, document requires sequential execution

---

### ℹ️ Issue #3: External Dependencies

**Dependencies Required:**
1. **Data Files:**
   - `DataSet.csv` (10,000 reviews)
   - `Mappings.json` (113 hash mappings)

2. **Python Modules:**
   - `text_preprocessing.py` (TextCleaner class)
   - `sentiment_analysis.py` (RatingBasedSentimentAnalyzer class)

3. **Python Packages:**
   - pandas, numpy, json, ast, warnings, collections, datetime
   - matplotlib, seaborn
   - sklearn (TfidfVectorizer)
   - scipy (stats)
   - tqdm (progress bars)

**Status:** ℹ️ DOCUMENTED - These are expected dependencies from the project
