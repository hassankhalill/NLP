   - Recommendations from Phase 10
   - Key visualizations

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

#### Gap 2: Monitoring and Retraining Modules ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Requirement:** Monitoring module and retraining module with KPI triggers

**Current Status:** Discussed conceptually, not implemented

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Mentioned in instructions but not in deliverables checklist

**What's Needed:**
1. **monitoring.py** module with:
   - Accuracy tracking
   - Latency monitoring
   - Request volume tracking
   - KPI dashboard/logging

2. **retraining.py** module with:
   - Data collection pipeline
   - Retraining trigger logic

- Option B: 3-4 hours

---

### Minor Gaps (Optional)

#### Gap 3: Model Performance Testing
**Note:** Instructions mention "tested against the real set of sentiment that we held out"

**Current Status:** We used all 10K rows for analysis

**Consideration:** Instructor may have held-out test set to evaluate our model

**Impact:** LOW - Our rating-based approach should generalize well

**Solution:** Ensure model can accept new data via API for testing

**Status:** ✅ Already addressed (API accepts new reviews)
